# Name of project: Trading-Bot-with-Henry. This trading bot uses an API from alpaca to paper trade stocks based on analyst's recommendations on whether to buy or sell a stock based on trading views API. First, the trading bot checks to make sure the market is open. If the market is open, it then iterates through a CSV file that I downloaded through nasdaq.com.com. I initially have the bot set to a smaller CSV file that trades stocks in the United States NASDAQ with a market cap above 200 billion. There is another file called NASDAQf that you can change the bot to trade on that has every stock in the NASDAQ in the United States. If analysts say any of the stocks listed in the CSV file are a buy, my bot will continue buying one share at a time of the company until I no longer have cash left in my alpaca paper trading account. It also continuously iterates through my portfolio to check if analysts change their recommendation to a sell and then sells all the stock out of my portfolio if true. At the end of a trading day, the bot will print the percent change in equity of my paper trading account. The bot will also stop trading once I start getting into margin in my account. After the market closes, the bot will still run every minute to check if the market is open again.
